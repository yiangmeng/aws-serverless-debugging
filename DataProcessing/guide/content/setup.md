## Setup

### AWS Account

In order to complete this workshop, you'll need an AWS account and access to
create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Cognito, Amazon Kinesis,
Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Cloud9 resources within that
account.

The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using
a given AWS account at a time. If you attempt sharing an account with another
participant, you will encounter naming conflicts for certain resources. You can
work around this by either using a suffix in your resource names or using
distinct Regions, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes
required to make this work.

Use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than
using an organization's account to ensure you have full access to the necessary
services and to ensure you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

### Region

Use **US East (N. Virginia)**, **US West (Oregon)**, or **EU (Ireland)** for
this workshop. Each supports the complete set of services covered in the
material. Consult the [Region Table][region-table] to determine which services
are available in a Region.

### AWS Cloud9 IDE

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets
you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code
editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools
for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
pre-installed so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for
this workshop. Your Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS
resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS Management Console.

Take a moment now and setup your Cloud9 development environment.

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Go to the AWS Management Console, click **Services** then select **Cloud9**
   under Developer Tools.

1. Click **Create environment**.

1. Enter `Development` into **Name** and optionally provide a **Description**.

1. Click **Next step**.

1. You may leave **Environment settings** at their defaults of launching a new
   **t2.micro** EC2 instance which will be paused after **30 minutes** of
   inactivity.

1. Click **Next step**.

1. Review the environment settings and click **Create environment**. It will
   take several minutes for your environment to be provisioned and prepared.

1. Once ready, your IDE will open to a welcome screen. Below that, you should
   see a terminal prompt similar to:

    ![](images/setup-cloud9-terminal.png)

    You can run AWS CLI commands in here just like you would on your local computer.
    Verify that your user is logged in by running `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

    ```console
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```
<button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    You'll see output indicating your account and user information:

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment $ aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```
    ```json
    {
        "Account": "123456789012",
        "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
    }
    ```

Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a tab throughout this workshop as you'll use
it for activities like building and running a sample app in a Docker container
and using the AWS CLI.

### Command Line Clients

The modules utilize two command-line clients to simulate and display sensor data
from the unicorns in the fleet. These are small programs written in the [Go
Programming Language][golang]. The below instructions in the
[Installation](#installation) section walks through downloading pre-built binaries,
but you can also download the source and build it manually:

- [producer.go][producer]
- [consumer.go][consumer]

#### Producer

The producer generates sensor data from a unicorn taking a passenger on a Wild
Ryde. Each second, it emits the location of the unicorn as a latitude and
longitude point, the distance traveled in meters in the previous second, and the
unicorn's current level of magic and health points.

#### Consumer

The consumer reads and displays formatted JSON messages from an Amazon Kinesis
stream which allow us to monitor in real-time what's being sent to the stream.
Using the consumer, you can monitor the data the producer and your applications
are sending.

#### Installation

1. Switch to the tab where you have your Cloud9 environment opened.

1. Download and unpack the command line clients by running the following command
   in the Cloud9 terminal:

    ```console
    curl -s https://dataprocessing.wildrydes.com/client/client.tar | tar -xv
    ```
<button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

This will unpack the `consumer` and `producer` files to your Cloud9 environment.

### :star: Tips

:bulb: Keep an open scratch pad in Cloud9 or a text editor on your local computer
for notes.  When the step-by-step directions tell you to note something such as
an ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN), copy and paste that into the scratch pad.

### :star: Recap

:key: Use a unique personal or development [AWS account](#aws-account)

:key: Use one of the **US East (N. Virginia)**, **US West (Oregon)**, or **EU
(Ireland)** [Regions](#region)

:key: Keep your [AWS Cloud9 IDE](#aws-cloud9-ide) opened in a tab

### Next

:white_check_mark: Proceed to the first module, [Streaming
Data][streaming-data], wherein you'll create a Kinesis stream, send unicorn data
to that stream, and visualize unicorn positions on a live map.
